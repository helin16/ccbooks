They belong to the categories of: Fashion and Beauty, Family & Culture, Military and Weapons, Literature and Fiction, Current Affairs and Hobbies.

Unlike other suppliers which might send you issues one by one from China as they come out, we keep the prices down by having all the issues sent over with our stock and send them out to you in bulk locally on a monthly base if you order more than 1 title, which can save a large amount of money for you on shipping costs. Like many other libraries, the titles you order depend on the requests of your customers. However, if you need help selecting more titles, we can suggest a few based on the demands of Chinese magazines sold locally through our Magazine retail locations around Melbourne.</span></font></p><p class="EC_MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: bold">BOOKS & DVDS</span></font></p><p class="EC_MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt">We supply Books and DVDs of all categories.
